********************* For collect result ***********************
1. To collect results for SPEC simualtion, run final_eval.py.

2. To collect results for synthetic simulation, run final_eval_synth.py
	# if want to compare varied subnets, set "varied_subnet" to true


********************* For simulation *************************

3. Run sim_DESIGN_SIZE.py to simulate SPEC2006CPU with DESIGN in a network of SIZE.
	# DESIGN = {BLESS, MBNoC}
	# SIZE = {4x4, 8x8, 16x16}
4. Run sim_DESIGN_synth.py to simulate synthetic traces in DESIGN.
	# DESIGN = {BLESS, MBNoC1, MBNoC, MBNoC3, MBNoC4}

******************* Other files ***********************
collect_stat.py: basic module to extract metrics of interest from EACH simulation output file.

MBNoC_collect_py: a intermediate module to collect and compute metrics of interest from a batch of output files.

my_print.py: print functions for different purpose, including printing the final output.

power.py:compute the static and dynamic power
